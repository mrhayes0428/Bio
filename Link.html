	<h1>Link Ruler of Hyrule</h1>
<p>
	Link is the primary protagonist of The Legend of Zelda series. His most iconic and commonly worn outfit is a simple green tunic and cap, although there are some exceptions, including the Goron and Zora Tunic from Ocarina of Time, and the Magic and Zora Armor from Twilight Princess. Link is canonically left-handed in all games except for Skyward Sword and Breath of the Wild. He is often depicted as the embodiment of nobility. He possesses the essence of the goddess Farore, the Triforce of Courage in every game except for The Legend of Zelda and The Adventure of Link.

	<h2>The Legend of Zelda</h2>	
		<p id="legend">
			Link is the hero and primary protagonist of The Legend of Zelda. When Impa, Zelda's nursemaid, tells him that Princess Zelda has been captured by Ganon and that she had split the Triforce of Wisdom into eight pieces before her capture, he embarks on a quest to rescue Zelda and defeat Ganon. Throughout his quest, he has to collect Heart Containers and find new items to complete his quest. At the end, he puts together the Triforce of Wisdom, slays Ganon, collects the Triforce of Power, and saves Zelda and Hyrule.
		</p>
		<br>
	<h2 id="adventure">The Adventure of Link</h2>
		<p>
			Link is the hero and primary protagonist of The Adventure of Link and starts off his adventure in North Castle, in front of the sleeping Zelda from the past. An older Princess Zelda would not tell her brother, the Prince, the location of the Triforce. The Prince hired a Magician to interrogate her, but after being unsuccessful, he put Zelda into a deep sleep. The Magician died shortly after. Unable to wake her, the Prince put her in a tower. Impa, the Princess's nursemaid, informs an older Link that the only way to wake this Princess is to recover the Triforce of Courage. Ganon's followers are after Link because they believe mixing his blood with Ganon's remains will resurrect him. Link is able to survive, recover the Triforce of Courage, defeat Dark Link, and awaken the Princess.
		</p>
		<br>
	<h2 id="majora">Majora's Mask</h2>
		<p>
			Link is the hero and primary protagonist of Majora's Mask and starts off looking for who is inferred to be Navi in the Lost Woods. A Skull Kid wearing a mysterious mask and his fairies Tatl and Tael scare Epona and Link is knocked off, unconscious. Skull Kid steals Epona and the Ocarina of Time from Link and rides into the woods. Link follows, and learns Epona has run off, but Skull Kid still has the Ocarina of Time. The Skull Kid turns Link into a Deku Scrub and leaves him and, accidentally, Tatl, behind. Deku Link and Tatl go on to follow them into a clock tower. They meet the Happy Mask Salesman, who tells them that if they can get the Ocarina back in 3 days before he has to leave, he can turn Link back into a Hylian, as long as he gets the Skull Kid's mask he stole. Link learns the Skull Kid has caused mischief across the new world he has entered called Termina, and that he is trying to get the Moon to crash into Clock Town and destroy the world at the end of Day 3. Link gets the Ocarina of Time back and uses the Song of Time to transport him and Tatl back to the beginning of Day 1. The Happy Mask Salesman turns Link back to a Hylian, leaving a mask behind that will allow him to turn back to the Deku Scrub whenever he wants. Link now must awaken the 4 Giants in the 4 compass directions to prevent the Moon from falling, and must repeat the same 3 days over and over until he can awaken them. After saving the Deku Princess and removing the poison from the Southern Swamp, bringing Snowpeak to spring, saving the Zora eggs and clearing the fog from Great Bay, and bringing peace to souls in Ikana Canyon. Link stops the Moon from crashing into Termina, but the mask the Skull Kid was wearing, called Majora's Mask and harnessing dark evil powers, takes over the Moon itself. Link lands on the moon through the portal left from Majora's Mask dark powers, and defeats Majora in his Mask, Wrath, and Incarnate forms. Link then leaves to return to Hyrule and continue his search for Navi.

	<h2 id="wind-walker">The Wind Walker</h2>
		<p>
			Link is the hero and primary protagonist of The Wind Waker and starts his adventure on Outset Island. He is the same age as Link was at the start of Ocarina of Time[citation needed]. Link's sister, Aryll, is kidnapped by the Helmaroc King after it drops Tetra in the island's forest. Link rides along with Tetra and the pirates on their Pirate Ship until he is shot at the Helmaroc King's stronghold, Forsaken Fortress. Link is knocked away, but is saved by a talking boat called the King of Red Lions, who offers to help Link save his sister. After getting the 3 Goddesses Pearls, Link goes underwater to a submerged Hyrule Castle. He pulls the Master Sword out, and goes back to confront the Helmaroc King. He defeats it and frees his sister, but learns the true evil is a man named Ganondorf, who was stopped by the Hero of Time in the past, but came back and caused the Great Flood that formed the Great Sea. The Master Sword, which was supposed to be able to defeat Ganondorf, has lost its power and Link is saved before he can be killed. Tetra is revealed to be Princess Zelda in disguise, and Link awakens the Earth and Wind Sages, who restore the Master Sword's power. Link recovers the broken-up Triforce of Courage and confronts Ganondorf again, this time with Zelda. Link and Zelda defeat Ganondorf, who is impaled through the forehead by the Master Sword and is turned to stone and dropped down to the bottom of the Great Sea. Link and Zelda, now back as Tetra, go in search of a new Hyrule. He has no true relation to the true "Hero" of Hyrule, yet the Wind Waker chose him.

		<br>
		<h2 id="twilight">Twilight Princess</h2>
		<p>
			Link is the hero and primary protagonist of Twilight Princess, where he is a ripe seventeen-year-old boy.[1] He works as a rancher, and lives in Ordon Woods.[1] He is dressed in a multi-colored shirt and pants, and sandals. He buys a slingshot and shows it off to the kids when a Monkey comes and Malo, Talo, and Beth run after the monkey. Talo keeps running after the monkey, while Malo and Beth get left behind. Link has to find Talo and the monkey. After he saves Talo and the monkey he returns to Ordon Village. The next day he prepares to go off for Hyrule Castle to deliver a gift, but Ilia notices a cut on his horse, Epona, and yells at him. Link must then go to Ordon Spring in order to retrieve his horse. After taking a secret passageway to get past the locked gate, Link reunites with Epona. But then the gate bursts open and a Bulblin knocks Link unconscious. Their leader then kidnaps Ilia and Colin and blows his horn, causing a portal to open. Link then wakes up and notices the children gone. Frantically, he runs after them, only to run into a huge black wall preventing him from proceeding. A monster pulls him through the wall into Faron Province, which is now covered in Twilight. This causes him to transform into a sacred wolf. He meets up with Midna in the Twilight Realm who becomes his partner for this game. Link meets Zelda and eventually returns to the light. Throughout the game, Link has to return the Tears of Light to the Light Spirits, and go through three dungeons to get three Fused Shadows. As Link progresses through Hyrule, he learns more about Midna, the Twili, and Zant and how all of the three are associated with one another. After collecting the Fused Shadows, Midna meets a terrible fate and Link becomes cursed to permanently roam as a wolf. He helps Midna visit Princess Zelda, who entrusts him to save the Kingdom of Hyrule from the tyranny of Zant, and tells Link a way to transform back into a human. He acquires the Master Sword, removing his curse, and travels to the Gerudo Desert to seek the Mirror of Twilight, which he finds has been broken by Zant. He then has to repair the Mirror of Twilight that was broken into four pieces. Once he does so, he has access to the Palace of Twilight. He goes there to defeat Zant and save Hyrule Castle from the Twilight. He eventually goes on to confront his old nemesis, Ganondorf and defeats him, bringing peace to Hyrule. In the end credits, he is seen riding away on his horse, leaving the Faron Woods to an unknown location, also leaving the Master Sword back in its pedestal. His role in Twilight Princess ranges from many things, but he ultimately strives to help Midna in reclaiming her power and helping her people.

		<h2 id="skyward">Skyward</h2>
		<p>
			Link is the hero and primary protagonist of Skyward Sword, starting off the game as a young, seventeen and a half years old[2] man living in Skyloft, who attends the Knight Academy. Link is dressed in boots, green pants and a sweatshirt, not unlike the rest of the citizens of Skyloft. He is a very active young lad who goes skydiving and bird riding to impress Zelda and his other classmates. Each of the citizens of Skyloft has a large bird called Loftwing that they use for transportation, but Link has a rare red Loftwing called a Crimson Loftwing that he befriends early on. Link is very close friends with Zelda and they seem to care greatly for each other. Early on in his quest, Link successfully wins the Wing Ceremony conducted by Instructor Horwell and this allows him to win a prize from Zelda.
<br>
			While Link and Zelda are riding off through the clouds, a sudden tornado is summoned, causing Zelda to fall off her bird and get sucked down into the land below. Link goes after Zelda, but appears to be knocked out cold by the huge fall. He is awakened by Gaepora, where Link tells him of the unfortunate news about Zelda. After Gaepora leaves, Link is confronted by Fi, the spirit of the Goddess Sword, who then accompanies Link throughout his quest, serving as his spiritual guide. Gaepora finds the two together Inside the Statue of the Goddess and they begin to discuss of the war between the Goddess and the Demon King. Afterwards, Link is entrusted with a green Knight uniform and he heads off.
<br>
			Link travels down to the land below in search of Zelda. Throughout his quest, he uses a standard set of inventory items that he upgrades along the way as he battles through the overworld and dungeons, attempting to save Hyrule from the evil that lurks there. Part of his quest takes him to the Silent Realm, where he must collect Sacred Tears and avoid Guardians without the aid of his sword or other items. He fights many foes along the way, but perhaps the Demon Lord Ghirahim is one of the most powerful. Ghirahim is also in search of Zelda and has no problem bringing Link within an inch of his life. He wants to resurrect his master, Demise, who is the strongest foe Link meets in this journey. His goal is to defeat Ghirahim and Demise, rescue Zelda, and save the lands of Skyloft and Hyrule. He ends up traveling all throughout Hyrule, learning more about the history of both Hyrule and Skyloft, and seeking to rekindle the Goddess Sword into the famous Master Sword along his journey.

		<br>
		<h2 id="between-worlds">A link between worlds</h2>
		<p>
			Link is the hero and primary protagonist of A Link Between Worlds. Unlike The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, Link has no known relatives. He is close with the Blacksmith, however, and Link originally works for him before setting out on his quest. [3]
		</p><p>
			Close to the beginning of Link's adventure, Link heads to the Sanctuary to deliver a sword to the Captain. Here, Link meets the primary antagonist of the game, Yuga, who proceeds to turn both the Captain and the Sage Seres into paintings.
		</p><p>
			After attempting to attack Yuga, Link later wakes up in his house after blacking out. Here, Link meets Ravio, who found him lying in the Sanctuary and brought him to the empty house.[4] Ravio later sets up a shop in Link's house[5] where he will rent[6] (and later sell)[7] his own items to use across the Overworld and in various dungeons. Ravio also gives Link a bracelet, which will allow him to become a painting after the events of the Eastern Palace.[8]
			</p><p>
			Distressed by the events in the Sanctuary, Ravio tells Link to visit Princess Zelda at the castle to inform her of what happened.[9] Zelda takes the events seriously and gives Link a charm that has been in the Royal Family for generations.[10][11] The Princess asks Link to visit the elder Sahasrahla[12][13] , who possesses great knowledge of past events and can give Link more information.[14]	
			</p><p>
			When speaking with Sahasrahla, the elder realizes that he sent the Sage Osfala to the Eastern Palace, where he is under threat of attack from Yuga.[15] He sends Link to warn the Sage[16], whom he meets at the entrance to the Palace. Osfala shoves him off however,[17] forcing Link to complete the Palace and watch the Sage be transformed into a painting by Yuga. Link is soon transformed into a painting much like the Captain; however, Ravio's Bracelet saves Link and allows him to escape the wall and transform into a painting whenever he chooses to.[18]
			</p><p>
			After leaving the Palace, Sahasrahla catches up with Link. The two soon hear a large earthquake centered at Hyrule Castle[19], which they find surrounded by a large magical barrier.[20] After Link shows Princess Zelda's charm to Sahasrahla, the elder realizes that it is the Pendant of Courage[21], one of three Pendants of Virtue needed to obtain the Master Sword.[22] Sahasrahla then sends Link to the House of Gales and the Tower of Hera to obtain the other two Pendants.[23]
			</p><p>
			Once Link obtains the Pendants, he heads to the Lost Woods to obtain the legendary Master Sword.[24] With the Master Sword in hand, Link then uses it to destroy the barrier surrounding Hyrule Castle, allowing him to enter and find the cause of the panic.[25][26] After navigating his way up the Castle, Link finds Yuga once more, who proceeds to turn Princess Zelda into a painting.[27] Link then gives chase after Yuga to the top of the castle, where Link uses Ravio's Bracelet to follow Yuga into Lorule.
			</p><p>
			Yuga then uses the paintings of all seven Sages to bring forth Ganon[28], whose power Yuga absorbs to become Yuga Ganon. Before Yuga can kill Link, Hilda, the princess of Lorule, steps in and traps the beast.[29] Hilda then transports Link out Lorule Castle before Yuga Ganon breaks free.[30]
			</p><p>
			Link soon wakes up in the familiar Blacksmith's House, however it is filled with Lorule residents that are unfamiliar to Link.[31] Hilda soon tasks Link with visiting all seven dungeons in Lorule to save the Sage trapped in each one.[32] After saving all seven Sages, they use their power to bring forth the Triforce of Courage, which Link takes with him to defeat Yuga Ganon.[33]
			</p><p>
			After making his way back to Lorule Castle, Hilda removes the barrier surrounding the castle[34], allowing Link to ascend it. Link soon finds Hilda at the top of the castle, where she takes Princess Zelda's Triforce of Wisdom and reveals her partnership with Yuga to take Hyrule's Triforce for their own.[35] Hilda then sends Yuga Ganon to attack Link in an attempt to steal his Triforce of Courage. [36]
			</p><p>
			Once Link defeats Yuga Ganon, Hilda still intends to take Hyrule's Triforce for her own[37], but is soon stopped by Ravio.[38] Princess Zelda and Link then enter Hyrule's Sacred Realm[39], and use the Triforce to restore Lorule's Triforce, returning the country to normal and bringing peace to both worlds.
		</p>
		<h2 id="breath">Breath of the Wild</h2>
		<p>
			Link, also known as the Hero of Hyrule, is the primary protagonist in Breath of the Wild. One hundred years prior to the game's current events, Link was chosen by the Master Sword to become wielder of the sacred blade and the one who would defeat Calamity Ganon. At the same time, Link was made Princess Zelda's appointed knight, and most of Link's memories entail his journeys during this time as Princess Zelda's protector.
		</p><p>
			Link's skill as a knight came with ease, something that Princess Zelda was continually jealous of and angry about when looking at her own continued failures to discover the Goddess Hylia's power that rested within. At first, their relationship was tense, and Zelda assured Link that she did not need his protection. However, as Link continued to fearlessly protect her and with Calamity Ganon's imminent return, she began to open up to him and discovered that the two were not so different.
		</p><p>
			Upon Calamity Ganon's return, events rapidly took a turn to disaster as Ganon used its powers to take over Hyrule Castle, and to corrupt both the Guardians and the Divine Beasts. With nowhere left to run, Link and Zelda were left to fight on their own and survive in a world they could no longer combat. In an open field outside Hyrule, Link bravely stood against a Guardian with his last breath, continuing to defend Zelda and fulfill his role. While at this moment Zelda unlocked her true power after instead defending Link, the hero collapsed to the ground and died in Zelda's arms.
		</p><p>
			However, when all hope was lost, the Master Sword began to glow with a blue aura and a voice from within the sword spoke to Princess Zelda. The voice was Fi, who was still present within the blade after the events of Skyward Sword. Fi told Zelda that Link could still be saved if taken to the Shrine of Resurrection, where after a slumber he would eventually be revived, ready to face Calamity Ganon once more.
		</p><p>
			After one hundred years had passed, Link was awoken by Princess Zelda's voice. It is here that the game and Link's journey begins, as he attempts to regain his memories, strength, and the ability to defeat Calamity Ganon before he breaks free to destroy the world. After freeing all four Divine Beasts from Ganon's control, Link makes his way to the Sanctum of Hyrule Castle. After defeating Calamity Ganon, and his pure form of evil known as Dark Beast Ganon, Princess Zelda seals away Ganon and both Link and Zelda finally fulfill their roles as the protectors of Hyrule.
		</p><p>
			Link is shown to be an extremely capable swordsman before Calamity Ganon's return, managing to earn the respect of the Master Sword, as well as taking down some of Ganon's strongest enemies singlehandedly. After regaining his memories and with the help of ancient Sheikah technology, such as the Sheikah Slate, Link recovers his former abilities and reclaims the Master Sword once again.
		</p><p>
			Throughout Breath of the Wild, Link often has an uneasy relationship with many of the characters. Some, such as the Zora, blame Link for the death of the Champions and Hyrule's demise. Others, such as Revali and other Champions, never believed in Link's ability, and did not see him as the hero that would save Hyrule. After Link freed each of the Divine Beasts and their respective Champions' spirits, they changed their mind and stood behind Link when he eventually faced Calamity Ganon in Hyrule Castle.
		</p><p>
			Princess Zelda's Diary is the first text in the series to give an explanation for Link's persistent silence. The diary states that with so many people watching him, and with so much at stake, Link feels it necessary to stay strong and silently bear any burden. This, in turn, causes him to stop expressing his thoughts and feelings, and rather, work to fulfill the duty he was chosen for.
